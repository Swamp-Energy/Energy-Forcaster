# Energy Forecaster Web App

## Overview

The **Energy Forecaster Web App** is an innovative tool inspired by the lessons learned from past energy crises, including the **Texas blackouts during heat waves**. These events underscore the urgent need for smarter, more resilient energy systems that can handle extreme weather conditions and prevent widespread outages.

Our app builds on milestones in conservation and sustainability, leveraging advanced machine learning to forecast energy consumption. By empowering communities, businesses, and policymakers with predictive insights, this tool enables better planning, optimized energy use, and a step toward a sustainable, blackout-free future.

## Key Features

- **Energy Consumption Forecasting**: Predict energy demand based on temperature, historical data, and other environmental factors.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: View energy trends through user-friendly charts and graphs.
- **Extreme Weather Alerts**: Real-time notifications for potential peak demand periods during heat waves or other extreme weather events.
- **Confidence Intervals**: Provide forecasts with confidence levels to enhance reliability.
- **Customizable Inputs**: Allow users to tailor forecasts based on location, temperature, and other variables.

## Why This Matters

The **Texas blackouts** highlighted the vulnerabilities of energy systems during extreme heat waves, leaving millions without power. With climate change increasing the frequency and intensity of such events, there is a pressing need to:
- Predict energy demand more accurately to avoid grid failures.
- Encourage conservation during peak usage periods.
- Empower decision-makers to optimize energy distribution and policy.

## Objectives

1. Prevent blackouts by providing accurate energy demand forecasts.
2. Support sustainability efforts through data-driven energy management.
3. Empower individuals, businesses, and policymakers to make informed decisions.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Machine Learning**: Python (TensorFlow, scikit-learn)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **APIs**: Weather API for real-time temperature data
- **Deployment**: AWS or Azure

## How It Works

1. **Data Input**: Users provide inputs such as location, temperature, and historical energy consumption.
2. **Model Prediction**: The app runs data through a pre-trained machine learning model to generate forecasts.
3. **Output**: Predictions are displayed as interactive visualizations with actionable insights and confidence intervals.
4. **Alerts**: Notifications are sent for potential peak demand or high-risk periods, enabling users to take proactive measures.
